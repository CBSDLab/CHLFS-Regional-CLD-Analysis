# Analysis of the Children's Healthy Living (CHL) Food Systems Regional Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) Scoping Model

This repository contains model and code for running analyses of the CHL Regional CLD simulation model. The Regional CLD system dynamics model was developed as a learning model based on synthesis of causal loop diagrams created in group model building workshops across the US Affiliated Pacific jurisdcitions (Alaska, Hawai'i, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and American Samoa). The CLDs from each jurisdiction were synthesized at the 2023 annual meeting in a group model building session with researchers and jurisdiction leads resulting in the regional CLD shown below.
