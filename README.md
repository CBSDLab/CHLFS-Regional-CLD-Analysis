# Analysis of the Children's Healthy Living (CHL) Food Systems Regional Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) Scoping Model

This repository contains model and code for running analyses of the CHL Regional CLD simulation model. The Regional CLD system dynamics model was developed as a learning model based on synthesis of causal loop diagrams created in group model building workshops across the US Affiliated Pacific jurisdcitions (Alaska, Hawai'i, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and American Samoa). The CLDs from each jurisdiction were synthesized at the 2023 annual meeting in a group model building session with researchers and jurisdiction leads resulting in the regional CLD shown below.

Major limitations of the CLD included the high level of aggregation that raised questions about the applicability of the CLD to local jurisdictions and the difficulty knowing how to interpret the qualitative CLD. Questions were also raised about how the CLD aligned with data and if there might be a way to evaluate the CLD emperically. 

To address these limitations and questions, a simulation model was developed based on the regional CLD where the CLD represents the core feedback theory of the Pacific regional food system. The primary purpose of this scoping model is to be able to emperically test the CLD against data and evaluate heuristics commonly used to interpret qualitative system dynamics models. For example, a common practice in analyzing qualitative CLDs borrows a technique from Theory of Constraints that compares the degree of causal variables influencing a variable or node with the number of effect variables to rank potential leverage points. Another example is the use of Donella Meadows' ranking of potential leverage points. A third approach draws on results from graph theory and centrality measures to infer leverage points based on the qualitative CLD alone. However, these heuristics for interpreting qualitative CLDs have not been formally tested.
